# This test fixture creates five user accounts spanning two research groups:
#   - `super_user` is a super user account
#   - `staff_user` is a staff user account
#   - `user1` is a generic account and is PI of the `Research Group 1` group
#   - `user2` is a generic account and is PI of the `Research Group 2` group
#   - `common_user` is a generic account and is a member of both research groups
#
# Both research groups have a single proposal with a single allocation.
