# Keystone REST API

The Keystone REST API serves as the primary backend service for the Keystone platform.
In addition to defining underlying business logic, it is responsible for orchestrating critical services to support
user-facing functionality and automated workloads.
This includes managing user authentication, asynchronous background tasks, and HPC integration through Slurm.
