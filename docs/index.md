# Keystone REST API

The Keystone REST API acts as the primary control plane for the Keystone platform.
In addition to implementing core business logic, it orchestrates a suite of critical backend services that enable
core user workflows. This includes managing user authentication and permissions, synchronizing resource allocations
across clusters, and monitoring cross-platform system health.
