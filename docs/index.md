# Keystone REST API

The Keystone REST API acts as the primary control plane for the Keystone platform. 
Beyond implementing core business logic, it orchestrates essential services that support both user and admin-facing functionality.
This  includes handling user authentication, synchronizing resource allocations across clusters, and issuing
automated user notifications.
