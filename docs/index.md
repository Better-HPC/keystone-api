# Getting Started

Keystone-API is the backend REST API for the Keystone web interface.
Written in Python using the Django Rest Framework, it provides management utilities for HPC resources.
Functionality includes:

- The allocation of HPC compute resources across one or more clusters
- The tracking of user research products including grants and publications
- The management of user accounts, research groups, and access permissions

For more information, see the resources below.
