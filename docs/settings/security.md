# Security Recommendations

This document outlines best practices for deploying a Django REST API application using PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, and Celery Beat. These guidelines aim to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your application and its data.

## General Guidelines

Secret Key. Passwords (postgres, redis)

### Restrict System Access

Limit access to the Redis server to trusted IP addresses or networks using firewall rules or Redis configuration settings.

### Encrypt in transit

## Network Security

### Isolate Where Possible

### Limit Hosts 

Always define the `SECURE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` list using a restrictive collection of domain patterns

### Enable CORS Safely

If your API is accessed by web clients from different origins, configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers to only allow requests from trusted domains.

### Use HTTPS

Always serve your API over HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between clients and the server, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.
Avoid issuing session/CSRF tokens over unsecured connections by enabling `SECURE_SESSION_TOKENS`
Consider using HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce the use of HTTPS

## Database Security (PostgreSQL)

Grant database permissions to users with the least privilege necessary to perform their tasks, minimizing the impact of potential security breaches.

## Redis Security

Enable Authentication
