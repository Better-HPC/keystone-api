# Design Guidelines

Keystone API uses the following design principles to ensure project consistency and maintainability.

## Request Error Handling

When an HTTP request fails, the response should provide a clear and unambiguous indication of the failure reason.
Since multiple validation steps may apply to a single request, the system follows a standardized order of validation
to determine the appropriate error response.
The first failing validation step dictates the returned status code to maintain consistency across all endpoints.

### Request Validation Hierarchy

1. **User authentication status:**
   Requests from unauthenticated users attempting to access protected resources must return a `403 Forbidden` error.
2. **Support for the requested method:**
   Requests using unsupported HTTP methods (e.g., `TRACE`, `CONNECT`) must return a `405 Method Not Allowed` error.
3. **Role Based Access Controls (RBAC):**
   Requests that fail RBAC or business logic authorization checks must return a `403 Forbidden` error.
4. **Additional request verification:**
   Any further request-specific validation logic must be processed in this step, with response codes adhering to
   industry-standard practices.

## Record Serialization

Consistent data serialization ensures predictable API behavior and simplifies integration with client applications.
API responses must adhere to the following serialization rules:

- JSON fields must map directly to a database or ORM model field with the same name.
- Primary key values must be read-only and cannot be modified by clients.
- Fields should maintain type consistency (e.g., integers remain integers, booleans remain booleans).
- Timestamps should follow the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).

## Serializing Relationships

When serializing relational data, all relationships must be represented using primary key values.
While an individual recordâ€™s primary key remains immutable via the API, primary key fields within nested relationships 
are writable when modifying associations (e.g., when adding a record to a relationship).

Nested representations of related entities should be included alongside primary keys.
These nested representations must use the same field name as the corresponding ID field prefixed with an underscore (_).
Nested representations must read-only and should only include fields required by downstream applications.

!!! example "Example: Serializing a One-to-Many"

    The following schema demonstrates a one-to-many relationship between the `Author` and `Book` models.

    ```mermaid

    classDiagram
        direction LR
        Author "1" *-- "0..*" Book
        class Author {
          +id: int
          +name: string
        }
        class Book {
          +id: int
          +title: string
          +publisher: string
        }
    ```

    When serializing an `Author` record, the `books` field is required and contains a list of primary key values.
    The `_books` field provides a nested representation with selected attributes.
    ```
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Book A",
      "author": 1,
      "_author": {
        "name": "John Smith"
      }
    }
    ```

    Serializing the relationship works similarly in the reverse direction, and while including reverse relationships is encouraged for consistency, it is not strictly required unless explicitly defined by the API contract.

    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Smith",
      "books": [1, 2],
      "_books": [
        {"title": "Book A"},
        {"title": "Book B"}
      ]
    }
    ```
